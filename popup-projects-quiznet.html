			<p>QuizNet is a networked homework system I built in 2018 for my A-Level Computer Science project.
            <p>It features a PHP webserver to handle the database, which stores data in a custom-written hierarchial CSV format. <s>Cause I was too cool for SQL.</s></p>
			<p>Secondly, a C# WinForms application is used by teachers to manage students & classes, create quizzes, assign them to classes, and analyse results.
				While less <i>a e s t h e t i c</i> than the other UI frameworks used, WinForms was chosen to feel familiar and simple to teachers already accustomed to
			management software like Sims.NET.</p>
			<p>Finally, a Unity game is used for the students' Client, allowing them to see their assignments and play quizzes. In contrast to the WinForms client,
				this 'UI engine' was definitely over-the-top, but both were a case of taking advantage of prior experience with the tools.</p>

			<p><b>Features:</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Unlimited students, classes, quizzes & assignments <i>(until the QuizNet admins invent pricing tiers)</i></li> 
				<li>Custom Quiz creator with extensive configuration options (time limits, random question selection, time limits, images etc)</li> 
				<li>Set deadlines for your assigned homework, to scare students with red boxes instead of blue ones</li> 
                <li>Logging and analytics of student performance</li> 
                <li>Secure storage of teacher logins & high database integrity <s>until you put a comma in the wrong place</s></li> 
                <li>Badly Reinvents the Database Wheel for Absolutely No Reason âœ…</li> 
                <li>Three separate software systems to perform what could easily be done with just one (but hey, loose coupling & apps!)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>As well as the software & presentation video, the project also consisted of a 30,000 word project report. For everyone's sanity, I won't be uploading it here.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, source code isn't currently available online. Mainly cause it's been years since I wrote it, and probably isn't worth spending time on.</p>
