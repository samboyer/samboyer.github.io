<p>My seventh entry into <a
href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/55">Ludum Dare</a> felt like a
real throwback.</p>
<p>The last time I did a solo game jam in Unity was <em>6 years
ago</em>. Back then, I hadn‚Äôt even started university, and probably had
&lt; 5,000 lines of code to my name. Fast forward to now, where I‚Äôve
written more lines than I care to admit, but in the domain of Big
Company Product instead of Small Throwaway Game<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Setting aside three non-work days to spend <em>even more</em> time
coding is sure to cause confusion in the office. But let‚Äôs phrase it
differently: I get three full days to do nothing but <em>make something
fun</em>, with no managers or approval chains to appease. It felt like a
protest against the exhausted, serious-code-only lifestyle I‚Äôve grown
into, and helped me remember why I even got into computer science in the
first place.</p>
<p>As you may expect, three days doing nothing but gamedev left me quite
mentally and emotionally drained for a couple days afterwards, but
plenty of other weekend plans will do that too ;)</p>
<hr />
<p>Before reading this post, take a look at my game: <a
href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/55/birb-world-tour-royale">Birb
World Tour: Royale</a>!</p>
<h1 id="pre-jam-decisions">Pre-jam decisions</h1>
<p>I‚Äôd decided to participate in this jam about a month beforehand, and
spent a lot of time thinking about what I wanted to work on. I decided
on aiming for these features/tools in advance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I wanted to make something in full 3D. I‚Äôve worked in 3D before,
but never shipped anything outside of 2/2.5D. Making a 3D game feels
completely different to a 2D game to me - not only do you need to
created textured &amp; animated 3D models instead of 2D sprites, but
character movement, camera control and level design works quite
differently in 3D. (VR games are an equally large design jump from 3D
games; it‚Äôs a medium I probably won‚Äôt revisit for a while.)</p></li>
<li><p>I wanted to use Unity, despite <a
href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/18/23879029/unity-pricing-model-change">the
licencing debacle last year</a>. This wasn‚Äôt an easy decision, but I
figured that</p>
<ul>
<li><ol type="a">
<li>I don‚Äôt personally suffer from the new pricing model,</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" type="a">
<li>I know how to use Unity‚Äôs API much better than Godot‚Äôs, and</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="3" type="a">
<li>The challenge I wanted to tackle in this Jam were that of game
design, art and music, not how to use a new game engine API.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>If someone looking to get into making indie games asked me now, I‚Äôd
recommend they start with Godot to avoid feeling ‚Äòlocked-in‚Äô to Unity.
Maybe I‚Äôll learn how to use it better someday too.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I wanted to make a ‚Äòrunning game‚Äô. I was randomly feeling quite
nostalgic for the late-00s Sonic games, where the gameplay boils down to
‚Äúrun very fast in one direction and sometimes interact with things‚Äù.
(Think Sonic ‚Äô06 Mach Speed sections, Sonic Unleashed Daytime levels,
maybe even Sonic Frontier‚Äôs open-zones.) The moments where you‚Äôre forced
to slow down for a 2D section or precision platforming are occasionally
fun, but my ideal platformer is one where the objective is to <em>go
fast</em>. (Would fast movement in open spaces still feel as gratifying
in the absence of slow, confined moments? I don‚Äôt know!)</p></li>
<li><p>I wanted to include AI opponents. Like, <em>lots</em> of them. I
also wanted to disguise them as real players that you‚Äôre connected to;
pretending I made a whole Battle Royale network stack in 3 days adds to
the silliness. Opponents, AI are otherwise, are a classic way to give
the player an objective (beat the opponents), and to populate the game
world a little. Let‚Äôs just hope the AI code can be competent without
taking up too many CPU cycles.</p></li>
<li><p>I wanted to make an original soundtrack for the game. I‚Äôve done
this before - modular music in <a
href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/54/temple-is-acid-feat-bees">TEMPLE
IS ACID</a> and chiptune in <a
href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46/bloom-eternal">BLOOM
ETERNAL</a> - but nothing that‚Äôs really stood out. Some of the
lesser-polished Sonic games are, <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/uvh08i/sega_on_their_way_to_make_the_best_music_for_the/">infamously</a>,
forgiven by having great soundtracks, which is the exact kind of exploit
I wanted in my toolkit.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="making-the-game-in-3-days">Making the game (in 3 days)</h1>
<p>I don‚Äôt really have any grand insights from this dev cycle, other
than I finished it in time üòÜ</p>
<p>The ‚Äòtasks‚Äô (‚Äòmake a model/texture/sound effect‚Äô, ‚Äòadd some code to
to X‚Äô, ‚Äòfix a bug‚Äô, etc.) were done in a somewhat random order, based on
what I felt more motivated to do at the time. Towards the end of the jam
I focused less on new features and prioritized bugfixes, playability
(i.e.¬†the core gameplay loop), then replayability via the unlockable
upgrades.</p>

<h2 id="what-went-well">What went well</h2>
<ul>
<li>It got finished! Regardless of what I hoped it would be, releasing a
game that does <em>something</em> fun is always an achievement. It has
original music, original models, and level design in a genre I‚Äôve never
worked in before. I got to show it to some friends at a party recently
and the positive reception was so rewarding.</li>
<li>Juicy graphics. There‚Äôs no coherency between the low-poly,
flat-shaded models, the pixellated-but-high-poly terrain, the toon
water, the electric particles, the sharp-angled UI, but <em>man</em>
does it look <em>cool</em>. I wish there were more particles.</li>
<li>‚ÄòEmergent‚Äô competitive energy. I was never expecting the AI
characters to put up a real fight, but as soon as I made some of them
faster than the player (and prevented them from perpetually falling into
the water‚Ä¶), it was actually <em>fun</em> to try and keep up with them.
There‚Äôs no navmesh, no ML agents; just random button inputs and 99
chances for the AI to succeed üòÜ</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-could-have-been-better">What could have been better</h2>
<ul>
<li>The player controller. For a game all about speed, the movement code
sure doesn‚Äôt handle it well! I put this down to the controller being a
weird mix between Rigidbody/projectile physics and traditional
character-runs-around-place code. I couldn‚Äôt get collisions working
without treating the player as a ‚Äòsphere with momentum‚Äô, which meant
that the moment you came off a ramp at 100MPH, you weren‚Äôt coming back
down for a <em>while</em>. I feel like watching more Sonic game footage
would reveal their tricks for keeping the player on the ground while at
speed, even while covering sharp corners, but I suspect the main
limitation was acting like a Rigidbody.</li>
<li>The soundtrack. A passing pre-jam thought was that I could spend
equal parts on gamedev and music production, but in reality I only spent
~4 hours on music. Considering <a
href="https://sb00.bandcamp.com/track/race-hazard">some of my more
complete tracks</a> can take about 20hrs each, this was nowhere near
enough time to make quality tracks - I ended up relying more on existing
loops and samples than I‚Äôd have liked. I think 4 race songs and 2 lobby
songs was enough variety and <a
href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/18ULQtzU0rroqb1Ccrhv7qThBw0HwnaNL">they
don‚Äôt sound <em>bad</em></a>, but maybe I could have written more and
only picked the top handful to include.</li>
<li>Task planning. There‚Äôs a lot of stuff in this ~5-minute experience:
code, world environments, level features, models, textures, UI, music,
sound effects, particle effects, stacking upgrades, and more. I jotted
out some ‚ÄòMVP‚Äô &amp; ‚ÄòNice to have‚Äô tasks in a Google Doc, which quickly
grew into a multi-page nested list of bugs, ideas, and reminders. Too
much time was spent just looking at this document and moving bullet
points around as I adjusted the scope/priorities. Maybe tools like
Trello could have sped this up? or resulted in more formality and thus
planning time?</li>
<li>Level design. Maybe I‚Äôm just asking for too much, but the original
plan involved ‚Äòtouring‚Äô between different levels/regions on rotation -
hence why the lobby and races are connected via tunnels. I hadn‚Äôt
anticipated how difficult Unity‚Äôs terrain system would be to work with
(particularly just placing objects on it), and that any non-barren
environments would take a <em>lot</em> of designing, so unfortunately
had to settle on just one. I even wasted an hour building a procedural
city block generator using <a
href="https://www.kenney.nl/assets/city-kit-commercial">Kenney building
assets</a>, but realised that without aggressive performance
optimization (LOD mesh/billboard swap-outs), and variations to make the
level <em>fun</em>, it just wasn‚Äôt usable. Ah well, one level it
is.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rage-against-the-matheme">Rage against the maTheme</h2>
<p>This isn‚Äôt related to game development, but more of an open question
to the Ludum Dare community: <em>to what extent does the theme
matter?</em></p>
<p>In previous jams I‚Äôve struggled to think of good game ideas that
relate to the theme, but always found some silly way of shoehorning the
theme into my game<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. This is definitely a shortcoming in
my game design ability, but given that limitation, shouldn‚Äôt I still
endeavour to use the 72 hours to make <em>something</em>, regardless of
theme?</p>
<p>This time, I had plans to shoehorn the theme in again, but couldn‚Äôt
quite work out the presentation style, and so left it themeless.
Thankfully, we‚Äôre allowed to opt out of the Theme rating category, but a
LD game that ignores the theme still just <em>feels</em> a bit wrong; as
expected, the lack of theme was brought up repeatedly in the review
comments, and probably impacted my Overall score a little. There‚Äôs a
whole section in the <a
href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/rules">LDJam rules</a> called
‚ÄòIs the theme required?‚Äô:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Officially no, you are not required to use the Theme. [‚Ä¶] To us, the
Theme is just a single voting category. [‚Ä¶] That said, it‚Äôs worth
understanding that all voting categories in Ludum Dare are opinions; The
opinions of your peers. [‚Ä¶] So as a general suggestion, if you want to
score well in Ludum Dare, make sure you do use the theme in some
way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a good stance from the organisers, but it raises the
question(s):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>To what extent does the community think about ‚Äúthemeiness‚Äù when
voting in categories other than Theme (e.g.¬†Overall)?</em></li>
<li><em>Does opting out of Theme affect how the community votes in the
Overall category?</em></li>
<li><em>In future jams, would the community prefer themeless games to be
declared as such (i.e.¬†by opting out of Theme voting), or to hide its
non-theme origins by shoehorning a theme into the
story/artwork?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I don‚Äôt know whether my score would be lower or higher if I spent
more time aligning my game with the theme than adding features, but it‚Äôd
be good for all of us to better understand the importance of themes for
future Jams.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Making games is fun! You should try it! A game jam is a good place to
start releasing things, although I‚Äôd recommend installing the editor and
following a tutorial project a few weeks in advance. Having a team might
also help decrease the workload for your first jam. Here‚Äôs some extra
tips while I‚Äôm feeling verbose:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Try to export to WebGL/HTML5</strong> where possible. Your
players will thank you for the lack of install/setup experience, but
obviously if performance is an issue for your game (i.e.¬†large 3D
environments are necessary) then you might have to settle for a
downloadable executable instead.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on juice.</strong> It‚Äôs hard to describe exactly what
‚Äòjuice‚Äô is, and especially hard to justify working on it in a Jam when
you also have critical gameplay code to write, but the amount of joy you
can create from these relatively tiny additions is always surprising to
me. These talks are a good introduction to the topic:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg">Juice it or
lose it</a> by Martin Jonasson &amp; Petri Purho</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=216_5nu4aVQ">Secrets of
Game Feel and Juice</a> by from the Game Maker‚Äôs Toolkit</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Remember, it‚Äôs a marathon, not a sprint.</strong> Three days
is a long time to be doing nothing but art/coding! Make sure you take
frequent breaks, go outside, sleep a normal amount, etc. Also, try and
plan for your workload to be evenly spread out over the jam period, so
you don‚Äôt need to crunch on the last day.</li>
<li><strong>Remember, it‚Äôs a sprint, not a marathon.</strong> Software
projects that are worked on for years need elegant code, good
documentation, and lots of unit tests. Chances are your game won‚Äôt be
worked on after the jam, so spending half of your time writing
testing/documentation/complex class hierarchies in your game code is not
a great use of your time. Similarly, don‚Äôt worry about
lower-quality-than-usual artwork and music - you can always go back and
improve it if you have time.</li>
</ul>
<p>As ever, if you‚Äôve been inspired to join a game jam or just mess
around in a game engine, let me know!</p>
