<p>This is a transcript of a YouTube video I made back in 2018 about
making a video game in 3 days. I‚Äôve added Editor‚Äôs Notes where I‚Äôve
changed my mind in the 6 years(!) since writing this script, so reading
this post is undoubtedly a better experience.</p>

<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>A few weeks ago there was the 42nd instalment of a game jam called <a
href="https://ldjam.com/">Ludum Dare</a>. For 2-3 days, thousands of
people around the world come together as teams or individually and try
to make a video game as quickly and as completely as possible (with
varying degrees of success). This is my third time participating and my
work resulted in ‚Äú<a
href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/ludum-dare-simulator-2019">Ludum
Dare Simulator 2019</a>‚Äù. (I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm actually allowed to use the
Jam‚Äôs name like this‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll assume it‚Äôs okay.)</p>

</figure>
<p>The idea of my game is that it simulates the Ludum Dare jam itself;
you have to construct a game, <em>within the game</em>, by playing six
different minigames. It‚Äôs it‚Äôs all very frantic and it was very fun to
make - I honestly thought I wasn‚Äôt gonna finish it at all but somehow it
did eventually get finished. After the jam, the games are rated by other
participants, then the results come out - I think it‚Äôs safe to say that
this time my results were‚Ä¶ <em>pretty good!</em></p>

<p>An additional challenge of Ludum Dare (and most jams really) is to
follow a theme in your game, which gets voted on by the community and is
announced as soon as the Jam starts. A few days beforehand, you get to
see about 15 themes that <em>might</em> be selected, so I sat down with
a few friends and tried to figure out some game ideas for each of themes
- this all got put into an ‚Äòtheme ideas table‚Äô. Some of them were
<em>much</em> better than others so I was sort of really hoping for one
of the good themes! But as everyone knows, <em><a
href="https://github.com/JamBrain/JamBrain/issues/1797">the theme always
sucks</a></em>.</p>

<p>The theme for Ludum Dare 42 is: Running out of space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was definitely not the theme I wanted at all - it was one of the
least populated entries on my ideas table. I sat in front of an empty
notepad for an hour trying to think of some new game ideas but just
<em>wasn‚Äôt getting anywhere</em>‚Ä¶ so decided to call a day (this was
like 12AM so not really unexpected) and get started the morning
after.</p>
<h1 id="day-1">Day 1</h1>
<p>I get a couple of new ideas! But they‚Äôre mostly just really bad puns
and wouldn‚Äôt tend themselves well to a game. I wasn‚Äôt happy with how
long I was spending having <em>literally nothing made</em>, so I made
the executive decision to‚Ä¶ just ditch the theme üò¨ (They‚Äôre more like
guidelines?? and I‚Äôm not too bothered about getting a lot position in
the theme category.)</p>
<p>One idea from the brainstorm that was stuck in my head was from the
‚ÄòOne minute‚Äô theme category - Ludum Dare Simulator. The original idea
was you‚Äôd have 60 seconds to produce a game, and it‚Äôd use WarioWare
style minigames to contribute towards ‚Äòbuilding‚Äô a game. It didn‚Äôt
really work with the theme, even after I tried to retrofit a ‚Äòdisk space
limitation‚Äô on it - it‚Äôs clearly just a timer!</p>
<p>Anyway, a spark was better than nothing, so I got going. The very
first thing that did was draw a UI mock-up on my whiteboard, and then I
drew it again in Serif DrawPlus‚Ä¶ and then I drew it <em>again</em> in
Unity. That was a waste of a few hours. <em>(<strong>Editor‚Äôs
note:</strong> no it wasn‚Äôt! The clean UI was a huge part of why this
game was successful. Mocking up in external software was very useful to
quickly prototype some designs, but the whiteboard stage maybe could‚Äôve
been skipped since I wasn‚Äôt working with anyone in-person.)</em></p>
<h2 id="minigame-1-physics">Minigame 1: Physics</h2>
<p>Once the menu was in Unity I started work on the first minigame. I
knew what the ‚Äògame data‚Äô categories to work towards would be (Code,
Art, Dialogue, Physics, Music, Effects), but not what game I‚Äôd make for
each of them yet‚Ä¶ The first one I knew what I would do was the Physics
game - it‚Äôs just a simple tennis game, where the aim is to keep a rally
going against‚Ä¶ a wall?</p>

<p>I spent about an hour trying to make a tennis ball ‚Äòlook right‚Äô
(modelling and the textures unwrapping properly), and that meant that it
got to 5PM on the first day before I‚Äôd even started scripting the
minigame! So as soon as I got that working I moved straight on to the
second game</p>
<h2 id="minigame-2-effects">Minigame 2: Effects</h2>
<figure>
<img src="ld42-effects.jpg" alt="Effects minigame screenshot" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Effects minigame screenshot</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Effects minigame is just a target practice game: targets appear
on the screen and you have to click them. Like the Physics minigame it
was fairly easy to code, but the time consuming bit was making particle
systems. When you clicked on a target, I wanted them to fire huge fancy
particle systems, to suit the name. I‚Äôm not sure if I should have been
spending so much time on fancy particle effects considering <em>nothing
was working at the moment</em> [i.e.¬†the main game loop], but it made
the minigame look fun, which probably helped its success.</p>
<h2 id="minigame-3-dialogue">Minigame 3: Dialogue</h2>
<p>I started on the third minigame, dialogue, at about midnight; this
one wasn‚Äôt too hard either. It‚Äôs a typing game where words appear on the
screen and you have to use your keyboard to type out the words. One step
here was finding a suitably big wordlist; fortunately I had one already
from an earlier project. I wrote a short Python script to filter out a
bunch of duplicate words and sort them by length.</p>
<p><em>Why sort by length?</em> The more time you spend in a minigame,
the more difficult they would get; e.g.¬†on the tennis game, more tennis
balls would appear, and on the Effects game, more crosshairs would
appear. So on the Dialogue game, the words will get longer and more
difficult to spell. Again, none of these features are really that
difficult to code; the challenge is figuring out game design ideas and
implementing them as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>This brought me to the end of the first day and things were not
looking very good. <em>(<strong>Editor‚Äôs note:</strong> Sure they were!
there were two whole days left! I just wasn‚Äôt experienced enough to know
I could close the game loop later on.)</em> I had 3/7 minigames
playable, but they weren‚Äôt really that fun to play? You could switch
between them, but there was still no overarching game controller.</p>
<h1 id="day-2">Day 2</h1>
<p>For the start of Day 2 I decided to make a bit of progress on that
game controller: I set up the ‚Äòenergy decline‚Äô system: after spending
too much time ‚Äòbuilding‚Äô your ‚Äògame‚Äô, you need to rest and recover your
energy. <em>(<strong>Editor‚Äôs note:</strong> I don‚Äôt think there was a
specific design reason that I added this feature, other than for having
a more accurate simulation of the Jam. But in hindsight I think it
creates a risk/reward opportunity? You can still play on low energy, but
your visibility is reduced/blurred, which lets the player choose exactly
when to recover.)</em></p>
<h2 id="minigame-4-code">Minigame 4: Code</h2>
<p>After that I moved on to the next minigame, Code, although I still
didn‚Äôt know what I was going to make‚Ä¶ so needed to spend more time
brainstorming. Eventually I decided the Code game would be one of those
block-based robot instruction games (basically <a
href="https://lightbot.com/">LightBot</a>). You control a robot and you
have to give it Forward, Back, Left/Right turn instructions to get to
the destination, and it executes the commands by itself. <em>‚ÄòOkay, I
can do that, can‚Äôt be too hard‚Äô</em>, I thought. Oops, it took about
five hours. Even worse, about three of those hours was just code for
dragging and dropping instructions from a pool to the instruction list.
Also the robot was currently just a white capsule - I‚Äôll need to fix
that later.</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="minigame-5-art">Minigame 5: Art</h2>
<p>I knew what this minigame would be from the start: you‚Äôd be given a
drawing and you had to recreate it on another canvas, using a limited
palette and very basic drawing controls. Again, this took ages, mainly
because I had to make up a bunch of reference sprites, and <em>they had
to look good because the whole gimmick was that you won‚Äôt be able to
recreate them with the limited tools!</em> I can‚Äôt do nice pixel art,
and I really wasn‚Äôt enjoying the task, but I did most of them while
streaming to Twitch which helped me get through. Eventually I drew
enough.</p>
<p>The next hurdle was writing the algorithm to compare the player‚Äôs
drawing to the reference sprite. I didn‚Äôt have any references for how I
should do that, so I just threw a bunch of random colour distance
calculations into the minigame script and hoped it would work‚Ä¶ (it
didn‚Äôt. but it was close enough to pretend it was thinking about
something.)</p>
<p>This brought me to the end of the second day. At this point I have
5/7 minigames working; they‚Äôre looking better than before, but still not
fully complete. And there‚Äôs still no overarching game controller.</p>
<h1 id="day-3">Day 3</h1>
<h2 id="minigame-6-music">Minigame 6: Music</h2>
<p>To start the third day I immediately got going on the final ‚Äòmain‚Äô
minigame, Music. It‚Äôs a straightforward Simon Says ‚Äòdrum loop recreation
thing‚Äô. It gives you a sequence of drum hits and you have to play them
back; the minigame script compares your input with its pattern and
awards you based on that. That meant I had to create <em>another</em>
accuracy scoring algorithm that cost me so much time the night before‚Ä¶
Somehow, this version worked out really well the first time!</p>
<figure>
<img src="ld42-music.jpg" alt="Screenshot of music minigame" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Screenshot of music minigame</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That meant that the music game only took about three hours to do. The
drum pattern production pipeline I‚Äôd made was working really well - it
meant I could type a drum loop in Microsoft Excel <em>(<strong>Editor‚Äôs
note:</strong> wtf???)</em> and I could churn out a bunch of drum loops.
They‚Äôre not very good drum loops - I‚Äôm not a beatmaker.
<em>(<strong>Editor‚Äôs note:</strong> <a
href="https://sb00.bandcamp.com/album/transgressions-in-cyberspace">I am
now a beatmaker.</a>)</em></p>

<p>At this point all six ‚Äòmain‚Äô minigames were done - in terms of code.
They‚Äôre still using a lot of placeholder assets and generally not
looking very nice, so I spent a lot of time refining the assets, adding
juicy animations/transitions in here and there, etc. One big thing I had
to go back and fix was the robot model in the code game. I used Blender
to model which is maybe a bit too unoriginal in hindsight‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Then I focussed on adding sound effects around the place, to improve
the atmosphere. Up until now, the game was unnervingly silent, which
definitely needed to change.</p>
<h2 id="the-final-stretch">The final stretch</h2>
<p>Soon enough I was at six hours to go and there was <em>still no
actual game loop</em>, because I kept putting it off. I‚Äôd been mulling
it over how the game controller would need to behave throughout the jam,
so I knew what I had to do for it; it was just a case of typing a ton of
code as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>At about four hours ago I decided the game needed a soundtrack‚Ä¶
possibly a mistake because that took about half an hour to find tracks,
trim them to be loopable, putting them in a ‚Äòmusic controller‚Äô script,
etc‚Ä¶ spending lots of time I didn‚Äôt really have.</p>
<h2 id="minigame-7-debug-t-3hrs">Minigame 7: Debug (T-3hrs)</h2>
<p>At three hours ago, most of it was coming together, but it was still
missing a final piece - the Debug minigame. I had this idea from the
start; once you‚Äôve done making your game you progress to the Debug
minigame, which is a really fast-paced final rush to eliminate as many
bug as possible. It was a very unnecessary addition to the game
<em>(Edior‚Äôs note: disagree!)</em>, but I just thought it would sell the
idea of this frantic development cycle, and gives a really nice finale
to the playthrough.</p>
<figure>
<img src="ld42-debug.gif" alt="Gameplay from the Debug minigame" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Gameplay from the Debug
minigame</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><em>(<strong>Editor‚Äôs note:</strong> ironic that I was using my final
hours of a jam making a minigame about squashing bugs in the final hours
of a jam, instead of squashing bugs in my game‚Ä¶)</em></p>
<p>It was a final race to draw pixel art and write code as quick as I
could.</p>
<h2 id="times-up">Time‚Äôs up!</h2>
<p>I got the Debug minigame done, thankfully, and had about 30 minutes
left to throw in as many extra bits of polish as possible. There were a
lot of things I wanted to improve, but to be honest I was just glad that
I even got the game finished!</p>
<p>I was finally ready to build and upload the game to the Ludum Dare
website, exactly on time.</p>
<h1 id="reflections">Reflections</h1>
<p>Considering how tight I was working to the deadline, there were so
many opportunities, especially on the final day, for just one thing to
go wrong and everything would have fallen apart. This was terrible
planning on my part and it should be a lesson for everyone: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make
your entire game in the last 10 minutes of a 72 hour game jam.‚Äù</p>
<p><em>(<strong>Editor‚Äôs note:</strong> Not sure I agree with this. If
you understand you/your team‚Äôs capabilities, and are good at estimating
how long it will take to ‚Äòdo/make X thing‚Äô, then it‚Äôs okay to put
critical tasks off until later. Sometimes you have to do it, because the
critical component can‚Äôt be made until the smaller parts are made;
sometimes it makes the task easier because the design can be refined as
you build up to it; and sometimes it‚Äôs a mistake to make components so
sequentially. In the case of this game, I definitely could have worked
on the overarching game loop script earlier in development, which would
have decreased the risk of ‚Äònot finishing‚Äô; but arguably the six/seven
minigames were equally critical to the ‚Äòfun‚Äô of the game. ‚ÄòPlayer
funness‚Äô is a hard metric to prioritize tasks by!)</em></p>
<p>Once the jamming was finished, all entrants had 25 days to play and
rate each of those games. Given I spent all my time developing, I had no
time to do any playtesting* or QA, so was just hoping that reviewers
would play the exact same way I did so bugs couldn‚Äôt be found‚Ä¶ A few
minor bugs were found by reviewers, but from what I could tell from
people were just really enjoying it! It was a huge relief to see that I
didn‚Äôt just waste three days making something that wasn‚Äôt even fun‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Comparing it to my first Ludum Dare game, <a
href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/ketchup-quest-endless-arcade-fighting-to-protect-your-saucy-stash">Ketchup
Quest</a>, I thought this one was a bit more contentful and had more
atmosphere, so I had an inkling that it would score slightly higher than
that. The problem with these results is that it‚Äôll be almost impossible
to top it in the future!</p>
<p>Perhaps in future jams I should push the boat out a bit more‚Ä¶? I
think the fact I was so familiar with Unity and C# it made it kinda
trivial to implement the ideas - maybe in the future I should try using
a different engine? <em>(<strong>Editor‚Äôs note:</strong> disagree - jams
are not a good time to throw out the tools you‚Äôre good at using. Trying
to pick up new engines in a time-pressured environment does not tend to
be enjoyable. Definitely do try out new engines, but maybe in advance of
a jam üôÇ)</em></p>
<p>Overall it was a really fun few days, and the amazing scores just
added to that. I‚Äôd definitely recommend checking out the Ludum Dare site
for yourself and <a
href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/games">trying out some of
the games that everyone made</a>. Some dev teams carry on working, and
produce ‚Äòpost-jam‚Äô versions of their games; maybe you‚Äôll see ‚ÄòLudum Dare
Simluator 2019 DX‚Äô hitting store shelves in the near future‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt
I don‚Äôt think so. I‚Äôll be too busy with university :P
<em>(<strong>Editor‚Äôs note:</strong> the university course was
time-consuming to say the least üòÖ)</em></p>
<p>If you‚Äôre interested in developing games yourself you totally should!
I‚Äôd recommend downloading Unity, try out the tutorials, and once you‚Äôre
confident enough, enter a game jam for yourself! It‚Äôs a really good
learning experience, and Ludum Dare is an amazing, positive, welcoming
community. I‚Äôd love to see your projects as well - if you make anything,
