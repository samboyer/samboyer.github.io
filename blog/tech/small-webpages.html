<p>In terms of page performance, the Web is in a bit of a state.
Websites are <a
href="https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-the-web">~6x larger than
they used to be in 2012</a>, resulting in a pretty terrible experience
for mobile users with slow connection speeds (e.g.Â while travelling
through the countryside), or with weaker CPUs. Reducing the size of your
website can alleviate both problems: your webpage will load faster on
slower connections, and will consume fewer resources.</p>
<p>I started paying attention to <a href="https://samboyer.uk/">my main
webpageâ€™s</a> weight a few years ago - hereâ€™s how itâ€™s changed since
then:</p>
<figure>
<img src="website_size_chart.svg" alt="Website size over time" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Website size over time</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><em>(I donâ€™t want this to be a repeat of <a
href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/#opportunities">Chromeâ€™s
Lighthouse recommendations</a> - an excellent set of tips for optimising
page load performance - so Iâ€™ll instead focus on more likely factors, or
things that Lighthouse doesnâ€™t cover.)</em></p>
<h2 id="shrinking-my-site-saving-the-world">Shrinking my site = saving
the world?</h2>
<p>Thereâ€™s an argument that reducing page sizes is important for
reducing the climate impact of your website, and the Web in general.
While partially true, page size and climate impact arenâ€™t directly
proportional for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dominant factor in the Webâ€™s climate impact is the end-user
deviceâ€™s energy consumption<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, which in turn is mostly
dependent on how much time they spend using your site - not the kind of
thing you can code your way out of.
<ul>
<li>Thereâ€™s other relvant factors here: DOM and CSS complexity affects
rendering times, and heavy Javascript usage will eat up the CPU - the
size of their respective files is a good proxy for their
complexity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Internet routers consume <a
href="https://www.academia.edu/download/49015594/978-3-642-01399-7_62.pdf">about
as much energy when idle than when at max throughput</a>, so halving
your page size probably wonâ€™t affect how much energy they use.
<ul>
<li>An industry-wideÂ movement to reduce file sizes <em>could</em> result
in less Internet capacity/equipment needed, considering how HD video
streaming and giant software updates are the dominant factors in
internet usage<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, shaving off a few kilobytes from a
webpage is unlikely to affect the Internetâ€™s growth trends.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>So climate impact aside, the main motivators are page load
performance and code-golf-style fun. Maybe you can even get yourself
into the <a href="https://github.com/susam/10kbclub">10KB Club</a>.</p>
<h2 id="invisible-changes">Invisible changes</h2>
<!-- ### Compress in-transit.

Unless you've set up your own HTTP server from scratch it's most likely enabled already, but make sure that your server gives out files with compression applied - Look for a `Content-Encoding` header in your HTTP Response Headers (Inspect Element->Network).

The cost of gzipping/gunzipping these files is almost certainly less than
the cost of sending uncompressed data over the Internet [citation needed], so this is defintiely a worthwhile option. Note that images, videos or anything already compressed won't usually be given a `Content-Encoding`, because compressing a file twice doesn't reduce the size any further - it usually increases it! -->
<h3 id="choose-better-file-formats.">Choose better file formats.</h3>
<p>Developed by Google in 2010 and officially released in 2018, the WebP
format is generally considered the best file format for sending raster
images over the Internet right now. It supports both lossy and lossless
compression, <a
href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/gallery2">alpha channels
(transparency)</a>, and animated images, all with <a
href="https://insanelab.com/blog/web-development/webp-web-design-vs-jpeg-gif-png/">better
compression ratios</a> than the existing JPEG, PNG, and GIF formats.</p>

<p><strong>How to switch to WebP?</strong> Not all image editors come
with WebP support built-in<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, and any upstream photos
are probably JPEG or PNG, so you may want to automate the conversion to
WebP images. I used <a
href="https://github.com/samboyer/samboyer.github.io/blob/860d870a1b6aaa0884b4c2f0274b8d3193ca7575/webp.js">a
short Node.js script</a> in the past, but nowadays Iâ€™d probably use a
wrapper around <a href="https://imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a>:</p>

<p><strong>Animated images:</strong> GIFs, belive it or not, were not
designed to share animated pictures. This means that while each frame is
somewhat compressed (using LZW - not great), thereâ€™s no comporession
<em>between</em> frames, so a long animation can become <em>very</em>
large.</p>
<p>Instead of GIF images, you should consider animated WebP images, or
(for better backwards-compatibility) MP4 videos in a
<code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag. <a
href="https://wordpress.com/go/tutorials/how-to-embed-video-wordpress/">WordPress
users can also use self-hosted videos.</a></p>
<h4 id="consider-svg-images">Consider SVG images</h4>
<p>SVG files are used for â€˜vectorâ€™ graphics, meaning instead of an array
of pixel data, an SVG file contains instructions to draw the lines and
shapes that comprise the image, which can then be rendered at <em>any
resolution</em>. This makes them extremely efficient for sharing large
images:</p>

<p>Deciding between raster (JPG, WebP) and vector (SVG) images will
depend on the complexity and display size of your images. For example,
solid line art that takes up the full width of your page is much better
as an SVG, but a detailed photograph should probably stay as a WebP
image.</p>
<h3 id="serve-your-images-at-the-right-resolution.">Serve your images at
the right resolution.</h3>
<p><em>(This doesnâ€™t apply to SVGs)</em></p>
<p>Since you usually know in advance the maximum size your image will be
viewed at, you can reduce the resolution of your image to this size. A
CMS like Wordpress might give you options for this in the page editor;
otherwise you may need to do it locally. All good image editors have a
resize option, including MS Paint and OSXâ€™s Preview ðŸ¥³</p>
<p>If your page is responsive, you might want to change which image is
sourced depending on the screen resolution. This can be achieved via the
<code>&lt;img&gt;</code> <code>srcset</code> and <code>sizes</code>
attributes (<a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images#how_do_you_create_responsive_images">more
info here</a>), or <a
href="https://css-tricks.com/responsive-images-css/">in CSS via <span
class="citation" data-cites="media">@media</span> queries</a>.</p>
<h3 id="dont-load-cssjs-that-you-dont-need.">Donâ€™t load CSS/JS that you
donâ€™t need.</h3>
<p><strong>Simple:</strong> If you donâ€™t need a certain CSS/JS
framework, donâ€™t use it. This happened to me with jQuery - lots of
StackOverflow answers use jQuery in their example code, leading us to
import a whole package to perform one task we probably could have done
with pure Javascript. If you can avoid dependencies on such libraries,
you can save 100s of kilobytes and avoid lengthening your critical
execution path.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced:</strong> Only include the parts of a
framework/library that you need.</p>
<p>CSS frameworks are an good option for styling a new webapp - you just
add one line to import the framework - but they usually contain far more
rules than you need to use. Tools such as <a
href="https://purgecss.com/">PurgeCSS</a> can identify unused rules and
remove them.</p>
<p>I didnâ€™t gain much from running PurgeCSS on my index page, since I
already keep my custom CSS file quite small, but on a WIP webapp that
imports Bootstrap I was able to reduce it from 233KB to 8.6KB
(<em>-96%</em>), without any loss of functionality ðŸŽ‰ (Note that it
wonâ€™t check for any rules activated via Javascript, so remember to set
the <code>safelist</code> correcttly!)</p>
<p>There doesnâ€™t seem to be an equivalent tool for removing unused
Javascript - possibly because itâ€™s impossible to obtain coverage via
static analysis - but thankfully a few CDNs are beginning to serve their
libraries in smaller pieces, such as <a
href="https://docs.angularjs.org/misc/downloading#!">AngularJS</a>.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is that youâ€™ll need to host these
customized files yourself, instead of linking directly to a CDN. This is
probably a good thing for performance (skips a DNS lookup and TCP
connection to the CDN), but youâ€™ll need to remember to update your copy
of the library/framework when needed.</p>
<h3 id="dont-load-fontsicon-sets-you-arent-using.">Donâ€™t load fonts/icon
sets you arenâ€™t using.</h3>
<p>When youâ€™re selecting fonts from a site like Google Fonts, itâ€™s easy
to select many weights of the same font in case you use them later; but
(unless youâ€™re using a fancy new <a
href="https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/introducing_type/introducing_variable_fonts">Variable
Fonts</a>), every weight selected is its own font file at roughly equal
cost as each other weight (e.g.Â ~170kb per weight for <a
href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto">Roboto</a>).</p>
<p>I donâ€™t have an easy technique for detecting unused fonts sadly, but
you could try checking which fonts are downloaded via DevTools -&gt;
Network -&gt; Filter on â€˜Fontsâ€™, then check that each weight is used by
<em>some</em> CSS rule, and finally that those CSS rules apply to
<em>some</em> visible elements.</p>
<p><strong>Trimming icon sets:</strong> Icon sets, like any other web
fonts, can get quite large. Font Awesome v4 (an icon set I used to use
on my site) weighs ~197KB (TTF+CSS file), but the handful of icons that
I actually used only weighed 6KB. Tools such as the <a
href="https://icomoon.io/app/">Icomoon app</a> allow you to trim an icon
set font down to the subset you need; Font Awesome also appears to <a
href="https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/setup/use-kit">offer something
similar now</a>.</p>
<h2 id="visible-but-cool-changes">Visible (but cool) changes</h2>
<p>The following suggestions are for people like (like me) you have no
designer to answer to.</p>
<h3 id="use-fonts-that-are-already-available-to-you">Use fonts that are
already available to you</h3>
<p>After youâ€™ve removed all the unused fonts/weight variants, you should
consider going the extra mile and removing web fonts altogether. Modern
OSes come packaged with beautiful fonts installed already, and a browser
can use any of them :) A particularly good <code>font-family</code>
option is <code>system-ui</code>: it resolves to San Francisco on
iOS/OSX, Roboto on Android, and Segoe UI on Windows - all lovely
sans-serif fonts with <a
href="https://github.com/system-fonts/modern-font-stacks#system-ui">many
weight options to choose from</a>. If you care about those <a
href="https://caniuse.com/?search=system-ui">5.5% of browsers which
donâ€™t support <code>system-ui</code></a>, however, you might want to
expand that macro into a long list of fallback fonts, like in GitHubâ€™s
stylesheet:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode css"><code class="sourceCode css"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>font-family<span class="in">: -apple-system</span><span class="op">,</span> BlinkMacSystemFont<span class="op">,</span> &quot;Segoe UI&quot;<span class="op">,</span> &quot;Noto Sans&quot;<span class="op">,</span></span>

<p>(<a
href="https://www.w3schools.com/csSref/css_websafe_fonts.php">â€˜Web safeâ€™
fonts</a> are guaranteed to be installed on any system, but you donâ€™t
need to limit yourself to them - just make sure you add one as a
fallback!)</p>
<h3 id="extreme-image-compression">ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Extreme image compression
ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥</h3>
<p>If youâ€™re willing to abandon flawless image quality and venture into
some more retro image compression techniques, you can get
<em>extremely</em> small image files.</p>
<p>Firstly: resolution. We already talked about reducing the resolution
to match, but thereâ€™s no need to stop there - you can reduce the
resolution as much as you like and scale it back upwards - just remember
to set <code>image-rendering: pixelated</code> in CSS to avoid blurry
edges.</p>

<p>Probably the most powerful example is replacing 24-bit RGB colour
with <em>indexed</em> colour profiles, where a small palette is declared
at the start of the file and pixels refer to that table instead of the
whole gamut. The palette is usually 8-bits (as in GIF images), but you
can reduce this as much as you like; 2-bit monochrome at low resolutions
can give you some really funky effects that resemble old GameBoy
graphics:</p>

<p>The <a

the weight of your page in the wild (i.e.Â outside of a DevTools
environment), or present it to the end-user, like I do in the top-right
corner of <a href="https://samboyer.uk">my website</a> (at the time of
