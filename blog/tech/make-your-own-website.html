<p><strong>Warning</strong>: while this is a beginner-friendly tutorial,
the intent is to teach you a bit about how the Web works. If you don’t
care about technology and just want to write stuff (which is fine!!),
you might be better off with a platform like <a
href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress.com</a> or <a
href="http://blogger.com/">Blogger</a>. (Both have export features, so
you <em>should</em> be able to move your stuff to a new site if
necessary.)</p>
<p><strong>What I’ll be covering in this post:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a GitHub Pages repository</li>
<li>(optionally) Registering a custom domain and linking it to your
Pages site</li>
<li>Adding content to your site via <code>git</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What I won’t be covering:</strong> - Absolutely everything
there is to know about HTML/CSS - Generating HTML from text/Markdown
(static site generators)</p>
<h1
id="step-1-make-a-github-pages-repository-and-put-something-in-it.">Step
1: Make a GitHub Pages repository and put something in it.</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If you don’t have one already, create a GitHub account <a
href="https://github.com/signup">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you’re logged in, create a new repository <a
href="https://github.com/new">here</a>, giving it the name
<code>'YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io'</code>. All the other settings
can be left at their defaults.</p></li>
<li><p>Now we’ll clone the repository to your computer, so you can add
files to it.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>If you’ve never use <code>git</code> before, I’d recommend <a
href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a> or <a
href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a>, both available on
Windows and OSX.</p></li>
<li><p>From your repository page on GitHub, click the green ‘&lt;&gt;
Code’ button. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, the ‘Open in GitHub
Desktop’ link should work; otherwise you’ll need to copy the
<code>'git@github.com/....git'</code> URL into your client. CLI users
can run <code>git clone git@github.com/...git</code>.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Create a file in your ‘checked out’ repository called
‘index.html’. Add some text like ‘Hello world!’.</p></li>
<li><p>Use your Git client to Commit and Push the file (sometimes called
Sync). When you reload the GitHub repository page, your new file should
appear there - and even better, navigating to
<code>YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io</code> in the web browser should
show that message you just wrote!</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="optional-get-yourself-a-domain-name">(Optional) Get yourself a
domain name</h1>
<p>By default, GitHub Pages are accessible on the web via
<code>'yourname.github.io'</code>. While this is a fine option for code
projects and the like, it has the following disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>You won’t be able to move the website off GitHub in the future</li>
<li>You won’t be able to register any subdomains (e.g. ), or use any
other DNS features (like MX records for mail servers).</li>
<li>You won’t be impressing any hipster domain connoisseurs with
‘.github.io’ in your domain name. (whether you care about that is up to
you.)</li>
</ul>
<p>When choosing a name:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure it’s one you’ll be happy with in few years time. Changing
a domain after the fact is a bit of a pain, and you’ll likely forget to
update the URL in a few places.</li>
<li>Be careful with unconventional TLDs, especially when they’re owned
by less-savoury countries/organisations. It’s fun to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_hack">combine domain names
with extensions</a> to make a word (e.g. <code>youtu.be</code>), or jump
on the whichever TLD is trendy this year, but <a
href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/brokeaf-goes-offline-as-afghan-web-domains-suspended-605232/">this
can and does result in unexpected domain suspensions</a>, or at the very
least <a href="https://www.spamhaus.org/statistics/tlds/">getting
blocked by lazy domain-level firewalls</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="add-some-proper-html-content">Add some proper HTML content</h1>
<h1 id="get-funky-with-css">Get funky with CSS</h1>
<h1 id="optional-use-a-static-site-generator.">(Optional) Use a static
site generator.</h1>
<p>Static site generators (Jekyll, Hugo etc) take in ‘preformatted text’
(think Markdown or .txt files) and output HTML. While this can be great
for speeding up the process of creating webpages (<a
href="https://github.com/samboyer/samboyer.github.io/tree/master/blog/make_blog.py">this
blog uses an SSG</a>), they’re not beginner friendly, and don’t make
sense for a website with few pages. Florens Verschelde summarizes the
topic well <a
href="https://fvsch.com/static-site-generators">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re comfortable with writing Markdown, and running commands
from a terminal, <em>and</em> plan to add lots of text to your website,
then a SSG might be worthwhile. In that case, Jekyll might be your best
bet - GitHub Pages can build your site from source each time you push to
the main branch. Otherwise, I’d recommend keeping a seperate
branch/repository containing your preformatted content, and writing some
precommit hook to commit the generated pages to the ‘production’ branch
(usually ‘main’, but this can be customised in the GitHub Pages
settings).</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>By now you should have a working website, either living under
github.io or your own snazzy domain name. Whatever you add now is up to
you!</p>
