<h1 id="welcome-to-my-blog">Welcome to my blog!</h1>
<p>It’s the slightly more unhinged corner of my otherwise composed
website, and honestly been a long time coming.</p>
<p>The thought of writing a few paragraphs about some topic has popped
into my head many times over the past few years, but I’ve never had a
good place to put things. Medium, Substack or were good options once,
but I feel like starting one of those implies to the reader that I’ll be
writing about the same topic for the next few years. Here, instead, I
can make a one-off post about whatever takes my interest.</p>
<p>Another perk of hosting it myself is that I have full control over
the styling of the posts. I’m sure this will be used for <span
class="rainbow"
style="font-family:Comic Sans MS; color:red;font-size:1em">very serious
purposes</span>.</p>

<p>For the techy peeps in the audience, here’s the current process:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve rolled my own static site generator because <a
href="https://xkcd.com/927/">I love worsening the problem</a></li>
<li>Posts are written in Markdown and comitted to a private GitHub
repository.
<ul>
<li><em>I find the <a
href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.gitdoc">GitDoc
VSCode plugin</a> really useful to auto-commit and sync the content
between devices. A cheapskate’s <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian
Sync</a>, really.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>A Python script invokes <a
href="https://pandoc.org/"><code>pandoc</code></a> to convert from
Markdown to HTML, add some boilerplate, and create the index pages.
<ul>
<li>I use made-up directives like <code>@draft</code> to skip a post I’m
in the middle of writing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The HTML files are then published to my public GitHub Pages. This
step is currently manual; I’ll think of something better if I start
posting more regularly.</li>
</ul>
<p>(I might write more about this method in more detail if it becomes a
thing.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy your stay and find something of
interest!</p>
<p>- Sam</p>
