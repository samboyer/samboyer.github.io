			<p>Simple Spectrum is a package I created for Unity developers looking to easily add an audio spectrum or volume meter into their scene. It's been released as a free addon on the Unity Asset Store and has been downloaded by thousands of developers!
            <p>By adding a single Spectrum component into a scene, an awesome audio spectrum can be made in seconds and customised to fit any requirement.</p>
            <p><b>Features:</b></p>
			<ul>
                <li>Easy to use custom Inspector views, with the ability to rebuild Spectrums while in Play mode</li> 
                <li>Logarithmic frequency sampling, providing a proportionate spectrum unlike the ordinary AudioSource.GetSpectrumData</li> 
                <li>Colour gradients to change the colour of each Bar depending on its value</li> 
                <li>Attack and Decay on both Bar scaling and colouring</li> 
                <li>Microphone Input, letting users see a spectrum of their own voice!</li> 
                <li>Curved spectrums; bend the spectrum into any angle you like and make circular or radial Sprectrums!</li> 
                <li>Multiple prefabs for different types of bar scaling, with Sprite, UI and Shaded equivalents for each</li> 
			</ul>
			<p>The package also comes with an OutputVolume script and prefab, which can be used as a volume level indicator.
			<p>The OutputVolume script has a static method to get the output volume (using RMS), which you can use turn any motion or effect into an audio-driven one!</p>

                <p>"I really, really appreciate when developers give to the community. This product is exactly what I needed, and I didn't expect to get it for free. It comes with a variety of examples, the scripts are easily configurable, the spectrum can be rebuilt during play mode... what more could I ask for? I had it working in my project within minutes."</p>
