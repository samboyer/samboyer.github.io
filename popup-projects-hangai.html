			<p>During an A-Level computing class, we were given the task of making a 2-player hangman interface. Upon adding adding a <i>random word</i> / single player feature, I had an idea to use that dictionary to my advantage...</p>
			<p>HangAI uses a dictionary of over 430,000 <small>(clean)</small> english words to try to win a game of Hangman for you. The user inputs the information they know (positions of included letters &amp; known excluded letters) and HangAI determines a list of every possible fitting word.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, it then uses <b>frequency analysis</b> to figure out which letter would be the best possible guess. Regardless of it being correct, this guess will cut down the pool of potential words for the next round as much as possible.</p>
			<br />
			<p>On a technical level, it's simply a few logical operators that loop over a huge word list, but it makes a pretty cool performance! It's especially impressive to opponents when long words are chosen in attempts to outsmart it, since in reality this greatly reduces the amount of potential words. <i>(i.e. Antidisestablishmentarianism ._.)</i></p>
			<p>It's pretty weird watching Hangman.exe and HangAI.exe playing against each other by plugging their responses into each other, and can sometimes indicate HangAI's weakness at small words. Since there's so many of them, it's difficult to effectively narrow down the pool before 10 tries are up.</p>
			<p><small>And yes, the green console colour <i>is</i> vital to the functioning of the program ;)</small></p>
