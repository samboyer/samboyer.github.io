		<p>CMD Relay is a communication system between Windows operating systems and Windows Phone 8.1, allowing remote command execution from your phone.
		<p>Through use of a WP8.1 app built from scratch, network administrators are able to effortlessly distribute code across a limitless amount of computers.</p>

        <p>Due to limitations in the Windows Phone 8.1 Runtime API, the commands cannot be sent directly from the phone, so a relay system is utilised.
		<p>The phone connects to a specific Windows computer which is running a Relay Service and sends the payload data. Through the use of PSTOOLS, the Relay Service then sends the commands to the target computers and returns the result back to the phone.</p>

		<p><u>Features:</u></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Separate pages to manage Targets, Relays and Payloads</li>
			<li>Send multiple payloads to multiple targets at once using the checkboxes</li>
			<ul><li>'Send All' functionality requires press of the camera button, which increases coolness by a solid 36%</li></ul>
			<li>Multiple payload types, allowing entire executable transfer to targets</li>
			<li>Targets can have a custom background colour!</li>
			<li>Background Relay Service for Windows desktop operating systems</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Runs automatically in the background with minimal impact or visibility</li>
				<li>Immediately decodes and sends payload commands to target computers specified by the app</li>
				<li>Fully automatic Relay service installer and uninstaller</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Support for multiple profiles; manage different networks separately</li>
			<li>Master credentials setting; set the credentials to be used for the whole network</li>
		</ul>
				
				
		<p><b>NOTE: </b>This application and communication system is <em>not</em> a hacking tool. Neither the app or the service contains methods to hack a computer system; credentials are required for the execution of any code on a target machine.</p>
